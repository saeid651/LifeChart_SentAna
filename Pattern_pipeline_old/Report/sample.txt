A sample narrative note:

2nd to oldest of four girls born to her parents; raised by her mother and father. 
Father was a pastor to a non-denominational church (belief system similar to the Pentecostal church). 
Starting in subject's early years, she was very quiet and shy in school- had friendships and
 was involved in and accomplished in extracurricular activities just was uncomfortable with extroverted kids, 
was afraid of conflict. Was academically achieved in all of her schooling. 
(High School years) Subject started to branch out from the belief system that her father had been teaching-subject 
went to school counselor to talk to someone about her inner conflict of wanting to please her father but 
wanting to think and act for herself more. (Age 18) 1st depressive episode- followed a break-up with her boyfriend, 
was indifferent towards people and activities that she once enjoyed, was fatigued and tearful all the time. 
Period lasted a little over a month. (Age 20) Worst depressive episode- subject was having a rocky relationship with 
her on/off boyfriend. She dropped out of track (which she had loved doing since the age of 6), 
stopped taking care of herself, had SI with plan but no intent. Subject went to a school counselor for one visit 
to discuss her helpless feelings but dropped out of school shortly after semester completed and started working. 
Currently has difficulty concentrating, puts herself down often but does not feel worthless, hopeless or helpless. 
Lack of confidence in herself and her focus issues make her anxious in how she is performing her job, 
worries often about her romantic relationship. Subject hates conflict of any kind with others and 
will avoid communicating her needs to "keep the peace" with co-workers and family.
